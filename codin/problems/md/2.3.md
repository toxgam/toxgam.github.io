= Delete Middle Node

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node
but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a
singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Example
* Input:the node c from the linked list: a->b->c->d->e->f
* Output: the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

== Solution

Use one loop to find the length of the linked list.
Use another loop to delete the middle element.
