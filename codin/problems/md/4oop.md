= 4 OOP

Write a program to demonstrate 4 features of Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

== Solution

We will create several classes:

* Animal: base class with an abstract method
* Cat: extends Animal, and overrides the abstract method in Animal
* Dog: same as above
* Zoo: stores a collection of Animals, and calls the abstract method in Animal
