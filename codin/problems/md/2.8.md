= Loop Detection

Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at
the beginning of the loop.

Definition:
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer
points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

Example
* Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C[thesameCasearlier]
* Output: C

== Solution

Use a flag dictionary to store traversed nodes.
