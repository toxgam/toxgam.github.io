Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the
additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

Example
Input:  "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

== Solution

Use two loop:
* First loop, count number of space to calculate the length of output
* Second loop, start from end of the string, ASSIGN each character into the
current output index
