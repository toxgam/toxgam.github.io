= Rotate Matrix

Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image
is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
Can you do this in place?

== Solution

Rotate the pixel such that:
(i, j) -> (i,  n - j - 1) -> (n - i - 1, n - j - 1) -> (n - i - 1, j) -> (i, j)
with i, j <= (n - 1) / 2
