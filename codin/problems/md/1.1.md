= Is Unique

 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
 What if you cannot use additional data structures?

== Solution

- In the first case, we will use a dictionary (or array) to mark if a character
of the string has appeared.
* Time complexity: O(n)
* Memory complexity: O(1)

- In the second case, we can either use nested for loop to check every pair of
characters for similarity.
* Time complexity: O(n^2)

- If we do not care for the mutation of input, we can sort input and check every
2 consecutive characters.
* Time complexity: O(nlogn)
