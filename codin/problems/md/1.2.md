= Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

== Solution

Calculate the occurences of each characters for both arrays and compare
these two array with each other
* Time complexity: O(n + m + c)
* Memory complexity: O(c)
(n, m is length of each string, c is number of distinct character)
