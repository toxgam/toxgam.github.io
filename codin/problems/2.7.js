/*
= Intersection

Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect.

Return the interÂ­ secting node.

Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value.

That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node
(by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are
intersecting.

== Solution

Use recursion to compare the tails of two linked lists.
